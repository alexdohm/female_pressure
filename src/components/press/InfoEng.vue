    female:pressure is a transnational online database for database and network
    of women*, AFAB, transgender, transfeminine, transmasculine, intersex
    (+gender optional), genderqueer, gender nonconforming, a-gender or/and
    non-binary DJs, musicians, composers, producers, visual artists, agents,
    journalists and researchers working in the realms of electronic music and
    digital arts. It can be searched after criteria like location, profession,
    style or name and is a publicly accessible source of information, a tool to
    disclose the existence and the work of women* in this seemingly male
    dominated field. In 2019, female:pressure celebrated its 21st anniversary.

    Designed and founded by Vienna based Electric Indigo in 1998,
    female:pressure can be considered a technological answer to the recurring
    complaints about the alleged lack of female artists in this field. Viennese
    open source expert Andrea Mayr carried out the programming and continuous
    advancement of the database. female:pressure can be proud of having over
    2700 members from 81 countries [April 2021]. Most of the members are
    hyperlinked to their webpages, many can be contacted via e-mail.

    "Why are there so few women* in the electronic music scene?" Each one of the
    listed artists has heard this question countless times. However, experience
    shows that women* are hardly less active. In fact, their activities are less
    recognized and also easily forgotten. The female:pressure project is
    continuously growing and advancing. Initially planned as a mere insight into
    the status quo, it now also serves as an archive. Over the years, we
    broadened the simple focus on women in favour of an explicit inclusion of
    transgender and non-binary members. One e-mail to infoATfemalepressure.net
    with information about a not yet listed artist and the artist’s confirmation
    with the necessary data is sufficient to become a member.

  <h3>vision</h3>

    female:pressure emphasizes the practicality and necessity of networking and
    communication in this area. It serves as a resource to obtain information
    about artists and activists from around the world who work in the fields of
    electronic music and digital arts. All DJs, producers, musicians, composers,
    singers, MCs, VJs, video artists, graphic designers, photographers, cultural
    workers, journalists and agents can log in and individually change their
    entries to keep the provided information up-to-date.

    In addition to the website, the artists can also subscribe to an internal
    mailinglist. The list gives the opportunity for exchange, planning of new
    projects, help, information, sharing of experiences, and jobs. Important
    results of the list’s activities were, amongst others, our FACTS Surveys
    [2013, 2015, 2017 and 2020], our press statement #female:pressure, the
    two-day Perspectives Festival in Berlin [both 2013], the VISIBILITY tumblr,
    our #Rojava awareness & solidarity campaign [2016] and the female:pressure
    podcast series [since 2018].
