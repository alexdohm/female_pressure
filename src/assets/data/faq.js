        From experience we can tell that people who are working in the realm of electronic music, the related visual arts, club culture, or digital arts benefit most from a membership because they share more common interests with the other members of the network than people from other fields.
        You don’t have to be a musician or DJ. We welcome booking agents, promoters, curators, researchers, journalists, dancers and many more professionals whose work is centered around electronic music.`,
