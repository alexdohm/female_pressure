		title: "Can anyone become a member of female:pressure ?",
		answer: `If you identify as a woman*, AFAB [assigned female at birth], transgender, transfeminine, transmasculine, intersex [+gender optional], genderqueer, gender nonconforming, a-gender and/or non-binary, you are very welcome to join the network.
        From experience we can tell that people who are working in the realm of electronic music, the related visual arts, club culture, or digital arts benefit most from a membership because they share more common interests with the other members of the network than people from other fields.
        You don’t have to be a musician or DJ. We welcome booking agents, promoters, curators, researchers, journalists, dancers and many more professionals whose work is centered around electronic music.
        `,
